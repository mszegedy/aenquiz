A program for quizzing you on words from certain lines of the Aeneid.
Possibly the most sophisticated program I have written to date, and
definitely the most well-maintained; I made sure that it was compatible
with Windows, OS X, and Linux. I'm not sure how; I don't remember having
a Windows computer available to me at the time. It's ironic I never used
VCS for this. I guess I didn't want to deal with that on top of
everything else. For actual usage instructions, read the (very thorough)
README at `aenquiz/README`. Seriously, it even has a version history.
