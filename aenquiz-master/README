My school email is `michaelszegedy (AT) students (DOT) berkeley (DOT) net'. I'm
afraid to give you my regular email, on the off chance that someone might abuse
it.

HOW TO USE
----------
First, load words to get quizzed on; for details on how to do this, type
`help load' at the prompt. Then, type `quiz'. Then it will ask you questions
about which word means what. If you answer with any part of the definition (no
matter how small, except if you don't say anything at all) it will accept it as
a right answer. If you do this four times, it swaps it out for a new word, until
there are no more words left. If you get a word wrong, that counts as getting it
right negative one times. Even though it's lax about verifying whether you
actually got it right, don't cheat! If you're stuck, just hit enter and it'll
show you the definition again. When you are getting shown a definition, press
enter to continue. Separate your answers with commas to match alternate
definitions, like this:

What is the definition of "pelagi"?
sea, plain

Sometimes the definition is missing a crucial part, like the actual definition,
or an alternative meaning that is very obvious (tot I am looking at you). It's
okay to cheat in this case. Just look the word up somewhere else afterwards.
It keeps track of how many times you've gotten a particular word right. The
more times you get a word right, the less frequently it'll ask you. If you're
missing TOO many words, because you've used the program so much, just delete
known.csv in resources/. Or you can also edit it and change the values for the
words; each number is a count of how many times you've gotten that word right.
If the word has principal parts, it might also ask you what the principal parts
are. In this case, you need to both get the definition right, and the principal
parts right five times. Type out the principal parts the prompt gave with the
definition, exactly the same way it was given (except that spaces don't matter).
For nouns, the gender is part of the principal parts, and is usually a single
character at the end of the parts. Example:

What are the principal parts of "vocis"?
vox, vocis, f

If you get even a single character wrong in the principal parts, it counts as
getting the whole thing wrong. If there are multiple sets of principal parts,
you only have to provide one of them. If the principal parts don't make sense,
please tell me; see the section of this README labeled `CONTACT INFO'.

HOW TO RUN
----------
Windows:
Extract all the items from aenquiz.zip. Then, install StrawberryPerl. Just
google it and run the .msi file they have on their website. Then, double-click
aenquiz.pl. When the computer asks what to do with it, just click "Run".
NOTE: Don't install ActivePerl. Install StrawberryPerl. ActivePerl is literally
made by capitalist pigs. Also, to change things like the terminal size and font,
right-click the top bar and select "Properties".

Mac OS X:
Copy the folder aenquiz/ to Documents. Then, open the Terminal in
/Applications/Utilities. Type `cd ~/Documents/aenquiz' into it and press Return.
Then, type "perl aenquiz.pl" into it to run the file.
NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you change your Terminal font and color
for this. You may simply go to Shell->New Window->Homebrew (or Pro is a good one
for this too) to select a better-looking terminal, or if you want more control
over the font then you can go to Terminal->Preferences->Settings and change the
font in the right pane.

Chrome OS:
Um. Sorry, but this is kind of impossible, because you can't really download
files onto your computer, can you? Regardless, you can access your terminal by
pushing Ctrl+Alt+=>, where the => is that right arrow key above 2 and 3. Just
type "chrome" and hit Enter. To go back to your normal screen, push Ctrl+Alt+<=,
where the <= is the left arrow key above 1 and 3. Maybe you can figure out a
clever way to run it? If so, totally tell me. I don't have time to make it into
a Chrome app, sorry.

Linux/GNU/etc:
Do I really need to tell you? Fine... navigate to the folder containing
aenquiz.pl and resources/ in your file manager. Right click the background, and
click "Open Terminal here". Type "./aenquiz.pl" or "perl aenquiz.pl" into the
terminal to run it. Or possibly just double-clicking it will work too, depending
on your system.
